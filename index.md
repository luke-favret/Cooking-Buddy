## What is Cooking Buddy?
Cooking buddy is an app that uses **AI ALGORITHMS** to help users, from inexperienced hatchling to wisened cuisinier, advance their cooking skills. Cooking buddy does this by assigning each user a 'Cooking Level' upon signup from a short questionnaire. Users are then reccommended dishes and techniques close to their cooking level. Upon completing a recipe, the user is asked to rate how difficult they found it. This, along with the learning of new techniques, causes the algorithm to re-evaluate a user's cooking skill. In other words, users will be encouraged to try more and more difficult recipes and techiques once they've mastered less difficult ones.
